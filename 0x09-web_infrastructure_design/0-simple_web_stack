--------
The issues are with this infrastructure:

-SPOF
Mayn point of failure that can make the whole system malfuntion

-Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Only one server exists, so when an element needs maintenance, it has to be shut down, so downtime is necessary

-Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
There is only one server so it can be problematic when it runs out of resources
